General:

    # Ledger Type: The ledger type to provide to the orderer.
    # Two non-production ledger types are provided for test purposes only:
    #  - ram: An in-memory ledger whose contents are lost on restart.
    #  - json: A simple file ledger that writes blocks to disk in JSON format.
    # Only one production ledger type is provided:
    #  - file: A production file-based ledger.
    LedgerType: file

    # Listen address: The IP on which to bind to listen.
    ListenAddress: 0.0.0.0 #127.0.0.1

    # Listen port: The port on which to bind to listen.
    ListenPort: 7050
